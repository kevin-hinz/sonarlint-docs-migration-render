#### Choosing which C#/VB.NET rules to run in Standalone mode
The SonarC# and SonarVB rules are implemented as [Roslyn VSIX analyzers](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/code-quality/install-roslyn-analyzers?view=vs-2019), and you can configure which rules are executed using the normal [ruleset](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/code-quality/use-roslyn-analyzers?view=vs-2019#rule-sets) mechanism in VS.

#### Choosing which C/C++/JavaScript/TypeScript/Secrets detection rules to run in Standalone mode
See [Choosing which C, C++, JavaScript, TypeScript or Secrets detection rules to run in Standalone mode](https://github.com/SonarSource/sonarlint-visualstudio/wiki/Choosing-which-C,-Cpp,-JavaScript,-TypeScript-or-Secrets-detection-rules-to-run-in-Standalone-mode)
